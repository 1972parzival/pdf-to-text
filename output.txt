Origins of the
Working-class Movement

Capitalism is a way of life. It is a way of life that we in the United
States take for granted. In a capitalist system, private entrepreneurs
advance a certain amount of capital. With this capital they build, buy, or
rent production facilities, purchase raw materials, and hire laborers to
work for them. The finished product is sold on the open market, and the
income from the sale of the product returns to the entrepreneur who
started it all. The entrepreneur consumes a part of this income and the
rest is used to repeat the productive process anew, to expand the process
of production, or to begin a new productive venture.

This way of life presupposes a number of institutions. It presupposes
the existence of entrepreneurs in possession of sufficient capital to begin
the production process. It presupposes the availability of production
facilities and raw materials that can be purchased or rented. It
presupposes the availability of workers willing to sell their labor power
for a fixed duration of time. It presupposes the existence of markets in
which the means of production, labor time, and finished products can be
purchased or sold. And it presupposes a stable political structure strong
enough to protect and maintain the property rights of buyers and sellers
in these markets.

In a capitalist system individuals depend on other people to produce
the goods and services each needs to survive. Survival depends on the
ability of these individuals to exchange the goods each has to sell for the
goods each needs to survive. Production is production for sale. Each
producer specializes in some particular product: food, blankets, shoes, or
bicycles, for example. And within the production process itself, each
worker specializes in some particular task: tanning the leather, cutting
the leather, sewing the seams, or attaching the soles or heels of shoes, for
example. Adam Smith, the great champion of capitalism as a way of life,
saw in this division of labor the potential for an enormous increase in

human wealth. He wrote, "The greatest improvement in the productive
powers of labour, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and
judgment with which it is any where directed, or applied, seem to have
been the effects of the division of labour."! This division of labor is
impossible without the existence of some system for exchanging
products. Within a capitalist system of production, competitive markets
provide the institutional structure that makes such exchange possible.
Within such markets the exchange ratios between various products, their
relative prices, are regulated by the forces of demand and supply.
Neither individual buyers nor individual sellers can set the prices for
commodities bought or sold. Each must accept the market price. "The
market price of every particular commodity is regulated by the
proportion between the quantity which is actually brought to market,
and the demand of those who are willing to pay."2

Adam Smith thought that production for sale within such competitive
markets worked to reduce the price of every commodity to the lowest
possible level. He contrasted the price of a commodity monopolized by
one seller with the prices of commodities sold under conditions of
competition between sellers:

The price of monopoly is upon every occasion the highest which can be
got. The natural price, or the price of free competition, on the contrary, is
the lowest which can be taken, not upon every occasion indeed, but for any
considerable time together. The one is upon every occasion the highest
which can be squeezed out of the buyers, or which, it is supposed, they will
consent to give: The other is the lowest which the sellers can commonly

afford to take, and at the same time continue their business.?

A seller may upon some occasion secure a price higher than that
necessary to sustain his or her business. If, for example, an entrepreneur
discovers a more efficient way to produce shoes, then that entrepreneur's
unit costs of production will be lower than average, and hence the
entrepreneur could afford to sell beneath the market price. This lower
unit cost gives the entrepreneur leeway as to how to price the product.
Either the price can be set at the market price, ine which case the
entrepreneur secures greater-than-average profits, or the price can be set

York: Modern Library, 1937), p. 3.

at below-market prices, in which case competing producers will be
forced to lower their prices or face extinction. In either case, competitive
pressures will force an adjustment in supply and in the market price of
the commodity produced. If the product is sold at below-market prices,
producers who cannot meet the competition of lower prices will drop out
of the industry, and the market price will fall to a level that is the lowest
that sellers can commonly afford to take. If the product is sold at the
market price with resulting higher-than-average profits, entrepreneurs
will be attracted into the industry, the supply of the commodity will
increase, and consequently, the price will fall to the lowest level sellers
can afford. It is in this sense then that prices in competitive markets are,
as Smith says, “for any considerable time together," the lowest possible
prices for the commodities produced.

This example of the effects of the discovery of a more efficient
technique of production illustrates three interesting features of
competitive markets. The first feature is the tendency of prices in such
markets to gravitate toward the lowest possible price sellers can afford.
A second feature is the self-regulative capacity of such competitive
markets. Changes in production techniques, in the supply of raw
materials, or in the demand for consumer goods automatically induce
corrections in the quantities of particular commodities produced, and in
the prices of these commodities, thus achieving a new equilibrium
around the lowest price sellers can afford. Third, the example illustrates
an incentive to innovation inherent in the pressures of competitive
markets. Each producer has an incentive to come up with more efficient
techniques of production--for the discovery of such techniques lowers
the unit costs of production for that producer and makes possible a
higher-than-average rate of profit for that producer. To be sure, this
advantage is temporary. Eventually competitors will adopt the new and
more efficient techniques, and the price of the commodity will fall. But
even temporary advantages result in a greater accumulation of wealth,
and incentives remain to seek out other production efficiencies as well.
Since these incentives work on every producer, the result is a systematic
tendency of competitive markets to encourage innovation and greater
efficiency in the process of production.

Capitalism is a way of life that has not always been with us. It has a
relatively late appearance in the history of humankind. Before
capitalism, for a period of roughly one thousand years between the fall of
the Roman Empire and the emergence of capitalism, life in Europe was
organized according to the system of feudalism. Under feudalism, the
land was divided into large estates, which belonged to the church, the
crown, or members of the feudal aristocracy. These estates were, for the

4 Origins of the Working-class Movement

most part, preserved and passed intact with the death of one feudal lord
to an eldest son or nearest male relative. The ruling lord was
surrounded by a system of subordinate nobles, some of whom were
granted control over parts of the higher lord's estate or held control over
smaller estates of their own. The feudal aristocracy was organized into a
pyramidal structure of relations of service and subordination. At the
bottom of the feudal class structure, beneath the aristocracy, was the
peasantry, a class that included the vast majority of the people of feudal
Europe. The peasants lived in villages on the feudal estates. They
farmed the land, both in plots allotted to their own use and in the fields
of the feudal lord. From time to time they were also called upon to help
in the building of roads and fortifications and in the performance of
whatever other work might be required to maintain the estate.

Life in feudalism differed in many ways from life in capitalism. In the
feudal system almost all production was done for local consumption.
Trade, exchange, and markets were not central to the provision of the
bulk of the goods necessary for consumption and renewed production.
As late as the early part of the twentieth century, remnants of the feudal
nobility in Russia continued to pride themselves on the self-sufficiency of
their estates. Unlike the wage laborers of capitalism who sell their labor
power on the open market and are free to travel wherever they like in
search of better pay or a better job, feudal peasants were legally bound to
the estate of their birth. They performed work for the feudal lord, not in
exchange for wage payment, but in response to the direct coercive threat
of the ruling aristocracy. For the most part, peasants lived and died on
the estates of their birth. The tasks they performed were predominantly
agricultural or directly related to the requirements of agriculture.
Production and the way of life organized around the tasks of production
remained largely the same for generation after generation. In contrast to
the dynamic, innovative character of capitalism, feudalism was
characterized by a repetitive and static way of life.

There was no single cause responsible for the transformation from
feudalism to capitalism in Western Europe. No attempt will be made
here to explain that transformation.4 But whatever the ultimate causes,

So Called Primitive Accumulation” (1867) (New York: International, 1973), pp. 713-760;

Origins of the Working-class Movement 5

the transformation involved at least the following factors. First, there
appeared a class of what might be called protocapitalists. For the most
part, these protocapitalists did not come from the landed nobility.
Instead, they emerged from the ranks of medieval merchants and
artisans who had established themselves in various European cities
where they had some independence from the domination of the landed
aristocracy. Second, there appeared also a class of wage laborers
available to be employed by the protocapitalists. These wage laborers
came from two distinct groups. Some were artisans and apprentices
who, because of the breakdown of the feudal guilds, were in need of
gainful employment. Others were peasants forced off the estates of the
landed nobility.

Capitalism began with the development of a system of manufacturing
in which protocapitalists paid wages in exchange for the use of the labor
power of these dispossessed peasants and artisans and then sold the
commodities produced in open markets that had developed in the cities
as a result of increasing trade. In its earliest forms this system of
manufacturing involved simply this change in the organization of
production. The technology employed remained the same as the
technology employed in earlier times. In many cases workers were not
even united under one roof. The key change turned on the introduction
of wage labor as the relation of production connecting workers and
capitalists. Subsequent to the introduction of this system of
manufactures, several factors—increasing division of labor, technological
innovation, and the bringing together of workers into large and
interconnected facilities for production—vastly increased the productive
powers of labor and started the capitalist system on the road to a
revolutionary transformation of life in Western Europe.

With its inherently dynamic character and productive efficiency,
capitalism pushed aside the old feudal ways of life. With the spread of
capitalism went the growth of the distinctive social classes of capitalism:
the owners of capital (the bourgeoisie) and the free sellers of labor power
(the proletariat). The bourgeoisie, this growing class of wealthy and
enterprising men, included many individuals who were not of the
hereditary nobility. They were excluded from positions of political
power reserved for members of the nobility. In addition, numerous
restrictions imposed by and in the interests of the nobility hampered
their business ventures, whereas a patchwork of special privileges and

Industrial Europe ( Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985).

benefits, paid for by taxes imposed on the rising bourgeoisie, showered
down on the ruling aristocracy. In a relatively short period of time the
rising bourgeoisie demanded an elimination of the privileged status of
the nobility and an equal share in political power. The result was a
contest for political power between the feudal aristocracy and the newly
created bourgeoisie. In England this contest, complicated by a clash
between conflicting religious sects, led through civil war and
dictatorship to the "glorious revolution" of 1688 in which the ascendancy
of the bourgeoisie was established. One hundred years later this same
conflict led to the great French Revolution, to civil war, and to
revolutionary war throughout much of Western Europe.

The revolutionary bourgeoisie proclaimed the natural equality of all
men and the consequent equality of rights belonging to all men by
nature. It demanded that careers be open to talent rather than reserved
for the nobility. And it demanded the subordination of kings and the
hereditary nobility to parliaments elected by the people. Capitalism, in
which each individual is free to trade as he sees fit and in which the will
of political superiors is replaced by the market forces of supply and
demand, seemed well suited to the needs of free and equal men. And in
lowering prices and increasing output capitalism held the potential for
making men rich as well as free. Adam Smith had argued that the
framework of capitalism served as an “invisible hand" by which the
effort of each to secure his own happiness was turned to the benefit of
society as a whole.° Smith's argument came after capitalism had firmly
taken root and after the political struggle for power in England. But in
showing how capitalism contained within it the prospect of increasing
wealth for all, Smith linked utilitarian considerations for the happiness of
all with the revolutionary appeal to natural equality and natural rights
that had accompanied the rise of capitalism. The result was the powerful
ideology of classical liberalism that saw in capitalism both the realization
of human freedom and the prospect of human happiness.

In his tempered and rational optimism Adam Smith personified the
spirit of the Enlightenment, which proclaimed both the emancipation of
humankind from its past and the bright prospects of its future. But if
Adam Smith saw in capitalism the vision of a better world, others found
in it a nightmarish degradation of human life. As we have seen,
capitalism required the existence of a class of free laborers who offered
their labor power for sale. These wage laborers, the proletariat, did not
appear out of nowhere. The great bulk of them were farmers who had

5. Smith, Inquiry, p. 423.

Origins of the Working-class Movement 7

been forced off the land. In England, which became the leading center of
the development of capitalism, most of the population in the late
fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries lived as small farmers on land to
which they had some right of use deriving from the traditions of feudal
law. From the fifteenth to the seventeenth centuries many of these
people were driven off their land. The feudal lords, hard pressed for
cash, began to convert the land from the production of grain for human
consumption to game preserves and sheep farms that produced wool for
sale. This enclosure movement, which involved fencing off the land for
sheep, brought also the conversion of farmed land into pastures and the
destruction of peasant homes, villages, and churches. Repeated attempts
were made to stem the tide of enclosures by royal decree. But the
nobility's need for cash prevailed, and by 1750 the small farmer had
largely disappeared from the English countryside.

However curtailed his rights may have been in feudal times, the
common peasant at least had access to the land he needed to grow his
food and to a house to shelter his family. With the enclosure movement
the peasant farmer was deprived of his house and cut off from the land
that had heretofore provided his means of survival. Thus liberated from
feudal ways, large numbers of these dispossessed rural folk roamed the
English countryside, some begging, some in search of work, and some as
bandits. Beginning with the reign of Henry VII (1485-1509), laws were
passed designed to curtail this vagabondage. According to an act of
Henry VIII (passed in 1530), beggars old and unable to work were to be
granted licenses to beg. Those able to work were to be "tied to the cart-
tail and whipped until the blood streams from their bodies, then to swear
an oath to go back to their birthplace or to where they have lived the last
three years and to put themselves to labor."” Later, the act was
strengthened to include provisions for second and third arrests for
vagabondage. “For the second arrest for vagabondage the whipping is to
be repeated and half the ear sliced off; but for the third relapse the
offender is to be executed as a hardened criminal and enemy of the
common weal.’8 During the reign of Henry VIII, 72,000 of these people
were hanged.? Subsequent legislation provided for condemning these
vagabonds as temporary slaves to anyone willing to feed them and put
them to work. Various of these laws provided for branding or executing

runaways and for putting these “slaves” in irons, chains, or iron rings
around the neck, arms, or legs. The laws also provided that the children
of vagabonds were to be taken from them and turned over as
“apprentices” to those who would put them to work.10

In this way, by the combined forces of need and legal terror, the
dispossessed rural people were herded into the new manufacturing
enterprises that were in growing need of wage laborers. Such a forced
transition from an agricultural way of life, governed by the traditions of
the village and the rhythms of nature, to life as a wage laborer in a
manufacturing enterprise, governed by the disciplined routine imposed
by competitive markets, was bound to have a traumatic effect on these
people. Their plight was made even worse by the conditions of life they
found in these emerging industries.

In the first place, the length of the working day was extended. In
agriculture, of course, the length of the working day is variable,
depending on the seasons and the tasks at hand. In the new
manufacturing enterprises the working day grew to fourteen, sixteen,
and even eighteen hours per day. With the development of large
manufacturing facilities, thousands of wage laborers crowded into the
growing factory towns. There they worked and lived in cramped, dirty,
and poorly lighted spaces. Their working places were often badly
polluted with dust or noxious fumes. In these places they were forced to
work at breakneck speed, standing throughout the long working day
surrounded by dangerous machinery. The streets around their homes
were unpaved. They flowed with mud and with the sewage of human
wastes and the wastes of animals people tried to maintain in these new
conditions. They suffered chronic health problems--particularly
respiratory problems--and many of them died at an early age from
disease or simply from exhaustion caused by poor nutrition and
overwork. In the early days of capitalism, the demand for wage laborers
exceeded the supply. To prevent competitive pressures from forcing
wages up, laws were passed limiting the wages that could be paid.
Wage rates were set in such a way that a single paycheck was insufficient
to support a family. In order to earn enough for families to survive, it
became necessary for women and children to enter the mines and mills
alongside the adult men. Children were often beaten for falling asleep,
failing to produce according to norms, or for spoiling a piece of work.
Under such conditions, family life decayed. Alcoholism and drug use
became avenues of escape for men, women, and children. Crime,

prostitution, illegitimacy, and child slavery became common. The
emerging industrial working class dwelt in a world of slums and
factories new to England that was not served by educational, cultural,
and religious institutions.

Some sense of what life was like for these people is provided by this
statement by Ann Eggley, an eighteen-year-old worker in a coal mine:

I'm sure I don't know how to spell my name. We go at four in the morning,
and sometimes at half-past four. We begin to work as soon as we get down.
We get out after four, sometimes at five, in the evening. We work the
whole time except an hour for dinner, and sometimes we haven't time to
eat. | hurry [pull a load of coal from where it was dug to the main shaft
where it would be taken to the surface] by myself and have done so for
long. I know the corves [basket or box filled with coal] are very heavy, they

sweat runs off me all over sometimes. | am very tired at night. Sometimes
when we get home at night we have not power to wash us, and then we go
to bed. Sometimes we fall asleep in the chair. Father said last night it was
both a shame and a disgrace for girls to work as we do, but there is naught
else for us to do. I began to hurry when | was seven and | have been
hurrying ever since. I have been 11 years in the pits. The girls are always
tired. 1 was poorly twice this winter; it was with the headache. | hurry for

Saturdays. We wear trousers and our shifts in the pit and great big shoes

This testimony is not untypical of early English working class
experience. No doubt life was hard for these people. But it was even
worse for those who could not find a job. By the nineteenth century the
growth in demand for wage laborers had slowed relative to the growing
supply of people looking for work. Unemployment became a serious
problem for large numbers of people. As early as the reign of Elizabeth
(1558-1603), taxes had been levied to pay for the upkeep of people unable
to work. In 1834 a new poor law was passed that provided for
workhouses to which the unemployed poor were to be sent. "Our
intention,” said one assistant commissioner, "is to make the workhouses
as like prisons as possible.” Another administrator said, "Our object . . .
is to establish therein a discipline so severe and repulsive as to make
them a terror to the poor and prevent them from entering."!2_ Diet was
reduced to a minimum. Personal effects were taken from the inmates.
Men and women were separated and same sex members of the same
family were separated from one another. A rigid schedule, labor, and
total confinement in the workhouse were enforced. By 1843 the
population in these workhouses had risen to nearly 200,000. Only
desperate people would go to such places. As E. P. Thompson observed,
"The most eloquent testimony to the depths of poverty [outside the
workhouses] is in the fact that they were tenanted at all.”!

The spread of slums, beggars, paupers, prostitutes, and criminals did
not go entirely unnoticed by the upper and middle classes. Although
many blamed the plight of the poor on their own sloth, lust, or base
characters, many others spoke out against the new system that had so
hideously transformed the English land and the English people. The
poets William Blake, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
and Percy Bysshe Shelley, lamented the barren values of the times and
called for a radical transformation that would fulfill the vision of the
biblical prophets and the hopes of the French revolutionaries. The
journalist and Chartist, William Cobbett, contrasted the pleasures and

Working Class in England (1844); and Karl Marx, Capital (1867,) vol. 1, chapter 15,
"Machinery and Modern Industry” provide first-hand accounts of working-class life in the
nineteenth century. E. P. Thompson, The Making of the English Working Class (1963),
provides a rich historical account of English working-class experience.

virtues of the vanishing rural England with the misery and moral
collapse of the emerging capitalist order. The same themes of loss of
traditional Christian virtues and of contemporary moral failure run
through essays of John Ruskin and Thomas Carlyle.

Both the romantic poets and the essayists looked on the England of
their time with a divided consciousness. On the one hand, they deplored
the degeneration of their times and in this sense looked back to an older,
more virtuous, and more noble time, when human beings were tied to
one another by bonds of duty, community, and friendship and not just
by self-interested contracts. On the other hand, they looked forward to a
future that would elevate humankind beyond anything ever before seen
in history. Neither the poets nor the essayists had any clear blueprint for
the society of the future. The poets, at least during the early stages of the
French Revolution, adopted a democratic stance that looked to the
overthrow of all ruling classes. Later, Carlyle and Ruskin called on the
upper classes to reform themselves and provide the moral leadership
necessaty to restore England to virtue and return happiness to its people.
Perhaps the most widely read and most vivid picture of the wretched
conditions afflicting the English working class was provided in the
novels of Charles Dickens. But whereas Dickens routinely saved his
heroes by the device of discovering that they had been born into a more
elevated station in life and arranging for them to be restored to it, this
solution was not universally available to the working class.
Consequently, it is no wonder that members of the working class began
to search for ways by which they themselves might struggle against their
masters and their conditions of life.

The American and French revolutions profoundly affected the
working class movement in England and the rest of Europe. In England
an awakening of sorts had already spread throughout parts of the
working class in the revivalism of the Methodists and Baptists in the
eighteenth century. While the religious revivalists such as Wesley
preached subservience to political rulers, they also preached about the
need for individual redemption. And in reaching out to the unchurched
working class, they affirmed the human worth of every Englishman. The
revivalist vision of heaven and hell and the need for rebirth, a radical
change in being, aroused the slumbering visions of equality and
messianic change that had stirred the English during the time of the civil
war a century earlier.!4 When the French Revolution destroyed the old

order in 1789 and proclaimed the dawn of liberty, equality, and
fraternity, many English working men and women saw in that
revolution the confirmation of the messianic hopes of radical
Christianity.

In the French Revolution the aristocracy that had ruled France since
feudal times was overthrown. Political representation was extended to
the Third Estate—-the "people" who were not of noble birth. Positions in
government, the army, the courts, and the church, which previously had
been reserved for the sons of the nobility, were opened up for anyone
with the talent to fill them. Peasants seized the land on many of the large
estates belonging to the aristocracy and to the church. The prerogatives
of the nobles were abolished. The power of the king was limited by an
elected assembly. And the freedoms of speech, press, religion, and
assembly were affirmed.

In the early stages of the revolution these changes were achieved with
minimal bloodshed. Members of the aristocracy, persuaded by the
philosophers of the equality and rights of man, joined the people in
dismantling the old order. Eventually, of course, elements within the
aristocracy did resist the change and, calling on the assistance of the
monarchs of Europe, made war upon the French revolution. In time, the
guillotine did its awful work on aristocrats and revolutionaries alike.
And in time, it became clear that what the revolution had achieved was _
not the liberation of the "people" as a whole but rather the freedom of the
bourgeoisie to crown their mastery of the economic life of the people
with laws more suited to their ends. As early as June 1791, the elected
assembly, which was dominated by spokesmen of the bourgeoisie,
passed legislation outlawing labor unions. With the defeat of the
Jacobins and the deliverance of power into more moderate hands, it
became clear that the revolution no longer aimed at the emancipation of
the people as a whole.

Two years after the overthrow of Maximilien Robespierre, members of
the Society of Equals were arrested and charged with conspiracy to
overthrow the government. The basic ideas of the group were set forth
in the Manifesto of the Equals, written by Sylvain Marechal in April 1796.
The Manifesto proclaimed that "the French Revolution is only the herald
of another revolution, far greater, far more solemn, which will be the last
of them all." And it made clear that the aim of this revolution was the
real equality of all persons. “We are speaking of something more
sublime and more equitable, the Common Good or the Community of
Goods. No more individual ownership of the land: the land belongs to no

Origins of the Working-class Movement 13

one. We are demanding, we desire, communal enjoyment of the fruits of
the earth; the fruits belong to all."15 The leader of the conspiracy was
Francois-Noél Babeuf, who had taken the name Gracchus of the Roman
brothers who were tribunes of the poor. In the Analysis of the Doctrine of
Babeuf by the Babouvists (1796), the charge of betrayal of the revolutionary
hopes of the people is clear. “The Revolution is not finished, because the
rich are absorbing all goods and are exclusively in command, while the
poor are toiling in a state of virtual slavery; they languish in misery and
are nothing in the State."!® At his trial Babeuf was uncompromising:

To reach a certain goal, one must vanquish everything that stands in the
way. Now, as to the hypothesis of social change in question, whether one
chooses to describe it, after the fashion of the plaintiffs, as subversive of the
social order or to characterize it, in chorus with the philosophers and the
great legislators, as a sublime regeneration, it is indubitable that this
change could not be brought about except by the overthrow of the

established government and the suppression of everything in the way.!7

Babeuf was executed later that year. His example would inspire
subsequent revolutionaries in France, as we shall see. For now the
important point is that the rhetoric of liberty, equality, and fraternity
could be seen from two perspectives. From the viewpoint of the
bourgeoisie it meant the equal right of all male property holders to vote
in elections, the liberty of each to express himself (however he could
afford to do so), and the equal right of each to exchange his goods in free
markets. For the working class liberty, equality, and fraternity meant the
emancipation of every man from the domination of others, equality of
material condition, and a community of equals.

In the early days of the revolution these differences were not so
apparent. The revolution appeared as an unprecedented break in the
continuity of history. It seemed to promise nothing less than the
emancipation of humankind both from the rule of tyrants and from its
own self-imposed slavery to custom, ignorance, and superstition. This
vision of the universal emancipation of humankind had an intoxicating

effect on certain elements of the English working class and the English
